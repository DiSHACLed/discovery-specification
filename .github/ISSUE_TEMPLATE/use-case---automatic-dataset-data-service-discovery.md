**1. Use Case Title:**
   - Provide a concise and descriptive title for this use case.

**2. User Story/Scenario:**
   - Describe the scenario or user story in detail. Who is the user? What are they trying to achieve? What is the context?
   - Example: "As a data analyst, I need to automatically find relevant climate datasets from a national data portal to analyze regional temperature changes."

**3. Problem Statement:**
   - Clearly state the problem that this use case addresses. Why is automatic discovery necessary? What are the current limitations or pain points?

**4. Desired Outcome/Goal:**
   - What is the desired outcome or goal of implementing automatic discovery in this use case? What should be achieved?

**5. Data Catalog(s) Involved:**
   - Specify the potential data catalog(s) involved (e.g., data.europa.eu).
   - If possible, provide links to the catalog(s).

**6. Data/Service Requirements:**
   - What kind of data or data services are being sought?
   - What are the required characteristics of the data/services (e.g., temporal coverage, spatial extent, theme)?
   - Do any related SHACL shapes exist already?

**7. Discovery Criteria/Filters:**
   - What criteria or filters should be used to automatically discover the required datasets/services?
   - Examples:
     - Keywords: "temperature", "climate", "regional"
     - Spatial extent: Bounding box or geometry
     - Temporal range: Start and end dates
     - License: Open Data, CC-BY
     - Theme/Category: Environment, Science

**8. Expected Output/Results:**
   - What is the expected output or result of the automatic discovery process?
   - Should the output be a list of datasets/services, metadata records, or direct data access?

**9. Additional Information:**
   - Include any other relevant information or context that may be helpful for understanding and implementing this use case.
